# ICC 2019 WC prediction

Predicting the winner of 2019 cricket world cup using AI.

I have used Machine Learning to make a model using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib to predict the results of ICC 2019 
Cricket World Cup. 

## Goals

- Use Machine Learning to predict the winner of ICC 2019 Cricket World Cup.
